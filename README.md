# Buoyancy-modified-Wilcox-2006-k-omega-RANS-model-in-OpenFOAM
The default turbulence model in OpenFOAM differs slightly from the Wilcox (2006) k–ω formulation. This work provides an exact implementation with buoyancy effects. Example cases include Rayleigh–Bénard convection, vertical heated convection, stratified Couette flow, plane channel flow, and internally heated convection.
